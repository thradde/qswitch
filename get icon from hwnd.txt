Process Name from hwnd
......................
Retrieve the window's process with GetWindowThreadProcessId.
Open the process with PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION and PROCESS_VM_READ access rights using OpenProcess.
Use GetModuleFileNameEx on the process handle.
If you really want to obtain the name of the module with which the window is registered (as opposed to the process executable),
you can obtain the module handle with GetWindowLongPtr with GWLP_HINSTANCE. The module handle can then be passed to the 
aforementioned GetModuleFileNameEx.


Get WIndow Title: GetWindowText
Now I can update my little focus-spy utility app to try: 
GetWindowText() if (text length == 0) SendMessageTimeout( ... WM_GETTEXT ... ); 
...just did it and it works beautifully. Thanks for sharing!

Region Window
.............

Win32 Regions

A region is just a shape that can be used to receive the same messages that a normal window would receive. To apply a 
region to a window, you must first declare a region handle (HRGN), define the region with calls to CreateRectRgn, 
CreateEllipticRgn, or CreatePolygonRgn (and there are others beyond this -- see the Win32 documentation), combine your 
regions into one region with calls to CombineRgn, and then apply the final region to your window with a call to SetWindowRgn.

Because a region is an object, you should DeleteObject them when you are through with them.

Here's an example, which creates a sort of "figure 8" region, and applies it to our window (with handle hWnd):

HRGN hRegion1 = CreateEllipticRgn(0, 0  , 200, 200);
HRGN hRegion2 = CreateEllipticRgn(0, 180, 200, 200);

CombineRgn(hRegion1, hRegion1, hRegion2, RGN_OR);

SetWindowRgn(hWnd, hRegion1, true);

DeleteObject(hRegion1);
DeleteObject(hRegion2);



This code block defines two elliptical regions and combines them into a "figure 8" shape by ORing them (RGN_OR) with
 the CombineRgn function. It then applies the region to the hWnd window with a call to SetWindowRgn.

Take a look at the source. I've added a member function to the PortScannerWindow class that creates a region the same
 size and shape of the app window. Because I'll want my skin to cover the entire window, I'll need to make sure the 
 entire window is covered by this region.

The member function that does this is Regionize(). It takes no parameters, and its task is to figure out the window 
size and create the appropriate region to cover it.

Here's the definition:

// Remove title bar and prevent resizing
DWORD dwStyle = GetWindowLong(m_hWnd, GWL_STYLE);
dwStyle &= ~(WS_CAPTION|WS_SIZEBOX);
SetWindowLong(m_hWnd, GWL_STYLE, dwStyle);

// Define and set the region
HRGN hRegion = CreateRectRgn(0, 0, m_pRect->right-m_pRect->left, m_pRect->bottom-m_pRect->top);

SetWindowRgn(m_hWnd, hRegion, true);

DeleteObject(hRegion);

return TRUE;



Notice also the bit of code that retrieves the window long from our app window, and removes the WS_CAPTION and 
WS_SIZEBOX styles if they exist. Essentially we are removing the title bar and preventing the window from being 
resized by the user -- you can, of course, have skins that can be resized, but let's not make this harder than 
it need be. And the title bar doesn't do us any good, since we're laying a bitmap over it in a few minutes, so... hasta.

We call this member function from WinMain, immediately after calling Show(). This function should definitely do 
some error checking, since the calls could fail, but we'll leave that until later (so we'll have something to do 
when we tighten this thing down for release!)

(If you want to have more fun than just creating a rectangular region, change CreateRectRegion to CreateEllipticRgn 
in the function to make your window a perfect circle. Neat!)
